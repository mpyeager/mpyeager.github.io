1. [ex01](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/06.00/06.ex01.go "Exercise 1")
   > Create a `function` with the identifier `foo` that returns an `int`.
   >> * Create a `function` with the identifier `bar` that returns an `int` and a `string`. Call both `function`s and print out their results.
2. [ex02](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/06.00/06.ex02.go "Exercise 2")
   > Create a `function` with the identifier `foo` that; takes in a variadic parameter of `type int`, pass in a value of `type []int` to the `function`, returns the sum of all values of `type int` passed in.
   >> * Create a `function` with the identifier `bar` that; takes in a parameter of `type []int`, returns the sum of all values of `type int` passed in.
3. [ex03](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/06.00/06.ex03.go "Exercise 3")
   > Use the `defer` keyword to show that a deferred `function` runs after the `function` containing it exits.
4. [ex04](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/06.00/06.ex04.go "Exercise 4")
   > Create a user defined `struct` with identifer `person` and fields `forname`, `surname`, `age`. Attach a `method` to `type person` with identifier `speak`, and the `method` should take the form of `person` stating their `name`, `age`.
   >> Create a value of type `person`, and call the `method` from value of `type person`.
5. [ex05](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/06.00/06.ex05.go "Exercise 5")
   > Create a type `square` and type `circle`. Attach a `method` to each which calculates and returns `area`.
   >> * Create a type `shape` with defines an `interface` as anything which has the `area` method.
   >> * Create a `function` `info` which takes type `shape` and then prints the `area`.
   >> * Create a value of type `square` and a value of type `circle`. Use `func info` to print the `area`s of the `square` and `circle`.
6. [ex06](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/06.00/06.ex06.go "Exercise 6")
   > Build and use an anonymous `function`.
7. [ex07](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/06.00/06.ex07.go "Exercise 7")
   > Assign a `function` to a `variable` and call that `function`.
8. [ex08](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/06.00/06.ex08.go "Exercise 8")
   > Create a `function` which returns a `function`. Assign the returned `function` to a `variable` and call the returned `function`.
9. [ex09](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/06.00/06.ex09.go "Exercise 9")
    > Demonstrate a **callback** by passing a `function` into a `function` as an argument.
10. [ex10](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/06.00/06.ex10.go "Exercise 10")
    > **Closure** is defined as _enclosing the scope of a variable in a code block_. Create a `function` and enclose the scope of a `variable`.
