   > Using the short declaration operator, assign values to `variable`s with the identifiers `x``, `y``, and `z``. Now print the values stored in those variables using a single statement and multiple print statements.
2. [ex02](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/01.00/01.ex02.go "Exercise 2")
   > Using the code from the previous exercise; at the package level scope, assign the values to three `variable`s. In `func main` use `fmt.Sprintf` to print all of the values to a single `string`. Assign the returned value of `type string` using the short declaration operator to a `variable` with the identifier `s`.
3. [ex03](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/01.00/01.ex03.go "Exercise 3")
   > Using the code from the previous exercise, at the package level scope, assign the values to three variables ...
4. [ex04](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/01.00/01.ex04.go "Exercise 4")
   > Create your own `type``. Have the underlying `type` be an `int`. Create a `variable` of your new `type` with the identifier `x` using the `var` keyword.
5. [ex05](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/01.00/01.ex05.go "Exercise 5")
   > Building on the code from the previous exercise; at the package level scope, using the `var` keyword create a `variable` with the identifier `y`. The `variable` should be of the underlying `type` of your custom `type` `x`. Now use `conversion` to convert the `type` of the value stored in `x` to the underlying `type`.
