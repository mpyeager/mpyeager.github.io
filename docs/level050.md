1. [ex01](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/05.00/05.ex01.go "Exercise 1")
   > Create your own `type` `person` with an underlying type of `struct` such that it can store the following data; `first name`, `last name`, `favourite 80s cartoon character`s. Create two `values` of `type` `person` and print out the `values`, `ranging` over the elements in the slice.
2. [ex02](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/05.00/05.ex02.go "Exercise 2")
   > Using the code from the previous exercise, store the values of `type` `person` in a `map` with `key` of `surname`. Access each value in the `map` printing the values.
3. [ex03](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/05.00/05.ex03.go) "Exercise 3")
   > Create a new `type` `vehicle` with underlying `type` `struct` with fields for `doors` and `colour`. Next, create 2x new `type`s with underlying `type` `struct`; `evSaloon` and `SUV`. Make the `SUV` a `fourWD` using `bool`, and make the `evSaloon` `luxury` using `bool`. Using `vehicle`, `evSaloon`, and `SUV` `struct`s, create a value of `type` `SUV` and `type` `evSaloon` and assign values to the fields using a `composite literal`. Print each of these values and a single field from each value.
4. [ex04](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining/blob/main/Hands%20On%20Exercises/05.00/05.ex04.go "Exercise 4")
   > Create and use an `anonymous` `struct`.
