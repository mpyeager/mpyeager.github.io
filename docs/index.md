# Greetings!
 I'm [Matthew Yeager](https://twitter.com/mpyeager), a Googler in London, and I've created this site as my working development site generally and, more specifically in the immediate, as my personal companion guide for the [Todd McLeod](https://twitter.com/todd_mcleod) [Go](https://go.dev "The Go programming language") training course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com "Main Site").

 I've also created this site to catalogue things I've learnt so that I can make new mistakes but, hopefully, not the same ones twice. :-)

 If any of this material is of benefit to you as well, so much the better, however please note that any and all Golang training materials herein remain the property of [Todd McLeod](https://github.com/GoesToEleven "IT GOES TO ELEVEN!")

TODO [:] General :
Explain why [Todd McLeod](https://twitter.com/todd_mclead)'s [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code) is one of the best I've taken. Ever. For any language.

TODO [:] Updates & Releases : Create bulk file renaming.

[Just take me to the GitHub repo!](https://github.com/mpyeager/GolangTraining)

# [:]Useful Documentation

2. [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com "Golang documentation with working examples")

# [:]Things I've learnt
1. When setting up Github, ensure that you've generated a [new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and added it to your SSH agent, keychain, and Github user account.
2. Check your remote repository URLs and change from [HTTPS to SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories#switching-remote-urls-from-https-to-ssh) if necessary ... if you don't, you'll likely get errors when you try to push.
3. There are many reasons to love [OhMyZsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/) which offers plugins galore, including the hugely useful [Github short commands](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Oh-My-Zsh_Git.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index).
4. If you're not using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), well ... you really should be.
5. Spelling mistakes have been the cause of almost **all** of the mistakes I've made ... and, through these mistakes, much of the learning and progress I've made.

# [:]Golang Language Tips
* `init`, `condition`, `post`
* `keyword`, `identifier`, `type`

# [:]Todd McLeod Life Tips
TODO [:] Make these into a t-shirt :-)

* Drop by drop, the bucket gets filled.
* Persistently, patiently, you are bound to succeed.
* If you want to see the future, look at the seeds you are planting today. Plant the right seeds today, you'll harvest a great crop tomorrow.
* You are cultivating the garden which is _your_ life. You need to go out and work the garden _every day_, planting seeds, tending the plants, watering the garden, and removing the weeds ... that which we can refer to as not beneficial to your garden or _unskillful_ ... you are going to have a good garden and realise a good crop.
* It's not your intelligence. It's not who you're parents are / were. It's not what culture you come from. The number factor for student success is **grit**.
* [Angela Duckworth Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance](https://youtu.be/W-ONEAcBeTk)
* Time on task. If you want to be good at anything, you need to get out there and do it _every day_. Set aside some time every day and **commit**.
* If you want to be successful, get in front of what's coming and let it hit you.
* Focus on what is important, not on what is urgent.
* Stress is the difference between what is and what you wish things were.
* If you no longer want it, you can have it.
* Try to be 100% focussed ... and 100% relaxed.

5. I try not to be a fanboy, but [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is some next level 'holy shit' IDE stuff.
6. [dotfiles](https://github.com/mpyeager/dotfiles) to help maximise efficiencies with command line and developer workflow.
7. Speaking of dotfiles, you can launch programs directly from terminal using `[program name]` `+` `.` _or_ `filename`. For example ...
* `code .` /or/ `code [filename]` will launch [VScode][4]
* `open .` /or/ `open [filename]` will launch [Finder](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201732 "Using Finder on Mac")
